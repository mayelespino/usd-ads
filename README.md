# usd-ads

## The Wiki
This is where I keep most of my notes and links to other resources related to the classes at USD: [Click here for the wiki home page](https://github.com/mayelespino/usd-ads/wiki)

## The class folders
I am keeping files related to the classes on folders. Each folder has the name of the class and the files I used for/in the class. In some cases these are binary files, like word or excell documents, which is not the best use of GIT.

Here is a list:

- [ADSCS500A - Statistics](https://github.com/mayelespino/usd-ads/tree/main/ads500a)

## The other folders
I keep files not directly related to the classes in this folder. Here is a list:

- [R files](./R) These are the files I am creating as I learn R.
- [Python]() Python files.
