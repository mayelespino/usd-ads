## Book2.csv

This is the workfile tab, from the data provided in class, exported in to csv. Turns out, this is not necessary for RStudio can import from Excell.

## ads500a.R
This is my experimental R script, once I have something I want to save I copy it to another file name, for example: ads500a01.R.

## ads500a01.R
In this file I do some very basic exploratory analysis and boxplots. In the first instance I take all the data. In the second instance I filter IN the data that where cylinders are not empty, this is to filter out pure electric vehicles and keep hybrids. 

### Including cylinders == ""
![empty cylinders](images/RStudio01.png){ width=50% }

### Excluding cylinders == ""
![non empty cylinders](images/RStudio02.png)
