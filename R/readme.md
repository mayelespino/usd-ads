## ads500a.R
This is my experimental R script, once I have something I want to save I copy it to another file name, for exampleL ads500a01.R.

## ads500a01.R
In this file I do some very basic exploratory analysis and boxplots. In the first instance I take all the data. In the second instance I filted out the data that where cylinders > 0, this is to filter out pure electric vehicles and keep hybrids.
